# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone forms the 10th course in [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialisation. The project forms the final stage of the course.
## :page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX stands out as the leading company in the commercial space era, revolutionising space travel by making it more cost-effective. They offer Falcon 9 rocket launches on their website for $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost efficiency is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the rocket's first stage. Consequently, if we can predict whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, we aim to forecast SpaceX's first stage reuse.
## :page_facing_up: What Questions Must Be Answered?
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits impact the success of the first stage landing?
- Has the success rate of landings improved over the years?
- Which algorithm is the most effective for binary classification in this context?
## :page_facing_up: Methodology
  ### 1. The Data Collection Methodology
- Utilising the SpaceX REST API
- Web scraping data from Wikipedia
  ### 2. Data Wrangling Performed
- Filtering the collected data
- Handling missing values
- Applying One Hot Encoding to prepare the data for binary classification

  ### 3. Conducting EDA using visualisation techniques and SQL
  ### 4. Implementing interactive visual analytics with Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 5. Predictive Analysis Using Classification Models
  - Building, tuning, and evaluating classification models to achieve optimal results
